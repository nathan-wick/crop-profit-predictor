## Problem
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, food prices have risen 11.4% from August 2021 to August 2022. With the war in Ukraine, sanctions on Russia, and climate change, food prices will continue to increase. To combat rising food prices, our farms need innovation.

## Solution
Crop Profit Predictor, a mobile application that uses Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to predict what crops will return the most profit for an individual farm.

When farmers use Crop Profit Predictor, everyone benefits because the farmer increases their profit, reduces the cost of crops their community needs the most, and reduces waiste.

## How Profits are Predicted
A crop's profit is predicted by the following factors:
1. Supply and demand in the local market
2. Weather data such as extreme weather events and supply of water
3. Cost of inputs such as equipment and labor
